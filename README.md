# PHPTraining
Hi, my name is David Rodriguez (AKA davidjguru) and I have created this project as a free training resource.
After some time seeing materials on PHP, object oriented programming (OOP) and other things, I have encouraged to create my own training course, focusing on a didactic, entertaining and progressive. With the objective of practicing with specific LAMP environments, three layer architecture and some interesting frameworks.
