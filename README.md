# PHPTraining
Hi, my name is David Rodriguez (AKA davidjguru) and I have created this project as a free training resource.
After some time seeing materials on PHP, object oriented programming (OOP) and other things, I have encouraged to create my own training course, focusing on a didactic, entertaining and progressive. With the objective of practicing with specific LAMP environments, three layer architecture and some interesting frameworks.

## Pre-requirements

Would be ideal to have a homogeneous environment to make this trip through PHP. I recommend a system to practice with the following characteristics:
Operating System: Unix-based (Debian, Ubuntu ...)
Webserver (for testing the scripts): Apache2
Database: MySQL
Text editor: Vim, Atom, Gedit ... however you want
And obviously everything related to the use of PHP: engine, libraries, connectors...

## And how to configure the environment?

Well, fortunately there is a lot of information about this on the Internet. Here I will put some links that I find interesting to install and deploy the work environment.

## Ok, but What is your approach?

Well, obviously there are many tutorials on programming in general and programming in PHP in particular, but I think my point of view, based on years of experience, learning, relearning, erasing the hard drive and guiding others on this path, Have led me to think that a more constructivist approach is necessary than behaviorist, very close to the immediate reality to model cases and better visualize the principles of programming. In addition, I believe that the process should be theoretical-practical, build bases and practice directly. That's where my approach is.
You may not like it. You may not be interested. Who knows? I, from my position, I'm just playing.

## What people are you recommended for?

In fact, this practical guide is based on the roadmap created by the user [@kamranahmedse](https://github.com/kamranahmedse) in Github ([see here](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)), especially in the way described for backend in the PHP7 branch. Everything is really oriented to learn to work with the stack PHP-MySQL-Node-Drupal and Git. It is based on my own experience and some ideas.

For more references, I recommend (much) read and practice with:
