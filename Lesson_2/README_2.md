## README_2: Basics

Well, now in exercise number two, we will create some basics examples in PHP fortesting knowledge about essential functions like arrays, strings and global variables. Enjoy!

### First step: Getting info about the user agent

We're going to check what kind of browser is using the visitor, so we check the named "user-agent", a kind of string that is sended as part of a HTTP request. This info is stored in a variable called $_SERVER, a superglobal variable in PHP that contains all the information about the web server. The data are stored in a array, so we're going to put it in our browser looking the value from the array. Open the file user_agent.php with your favourite text editor and see the code.
