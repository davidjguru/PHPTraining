## README_2: Basics

Well, now in exercise number two, we will create some basics examples in PHP fortesting knowledge about essential functions like arrays, strings and global variables. Enjoy!

### First step: Getting info about the user agent

We're going to check what kind of browser is using the visitor, so we check the named "user-agent", a kind of string that is sended as part of a HTTP request. This info is stored in a variable called $_SERVER, a superglobal variable in PHP that contains all the information about the web server. The data are stored in a array, so we're going to put it in our browser looking the value from the array. Open the file user_agent.php with your favourite text editor and see the code. 

### Step Two: Basics about PHP as language

#### Variables

 
#### Strings


#### Arrays

If you have some experience with other programming languages or data structures
in general, you might be aware of two data structures that are very common and
useful: lists and maps.

List: ["Red", "Green", "Yellow"]

Map: {
"name": "Luke Skywalker",
"status": "dead"
}


Well, in PHP, we don't have lists and maps; we have arrays. An array is a data structure that implements both, a list and a map. And It's the main data storage structure.
