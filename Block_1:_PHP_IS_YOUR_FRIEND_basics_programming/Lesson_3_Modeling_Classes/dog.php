 * All code is -or will be- placed here.
 * The class keyword is lowercase and the name
 * of the class Dog begins with an uppercase.
 * PHP will allow you to create a class with a
 * lowercase first letter but it's not a style
 * rule.
 *
 * Class names cannot include spaces. You should
 * also avoid using special characters.
