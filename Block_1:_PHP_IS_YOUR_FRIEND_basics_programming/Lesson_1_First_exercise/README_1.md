## README_1: First examples

In this first exercise we will implement a small case of connection via AJAX: first, 
we'll create a PHP extension file as HelloWorld and then, we'll build a basic web application
with elemmental architecture consisting of an HTML base file, a CSS style sheet for playing 
with color changes and forms in the visualization tier and a complementary javascript file
to make the request of data, from which we will launch the search request of the file 
helloWorld_PHP7.php and extract its content to show it in the main page.

Enjoy!
