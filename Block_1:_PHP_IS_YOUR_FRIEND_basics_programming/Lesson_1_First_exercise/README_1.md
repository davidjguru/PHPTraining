## README_1: First examples

This first lesson is oriented to understand how it works a basic structure. 

### Welcome to the first lesson of this crazy course

Ok, in the first step, we're going to implement a basic structure, that includes the classic parts of a web application: we have a js (javascript file), a css file (style sheet), html and a php file for make a simple Hello World. 


### Goals

The simple goal of this first lesson is only understand the structure of an AJAX application for web, how many files are and how are they related. This is the basic map. Everything we do in this course will be around this kind of structure. 



### Idea

In this first exercise we will implement a small case of connection via AJAX: first, 
we'll create a PHP extension file as HelloWorld and then, we'll build a basic web application
with elemmental architecture consisting of an HTML base file, a CSS style sheet for playing 
with color changes and forms in the visualization tier and a complementary javascript file
to make the request of data, from which we will launch the search request of the file 
helloWorld_PHP7.php and extract its content to show it in the main page.

**Enjoy!**
