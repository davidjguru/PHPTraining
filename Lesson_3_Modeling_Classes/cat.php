	/*A class contains properties or also called
	 * variables. Properties include characteristics
	 * of the class. When an instance of a class is created, 
	 * the properties are unique for that object.
	 *
	 * The operating system reserves a space in memory to hold
	 * the properties. Properties can hold many different types
	 * of data, but PHP not require the defining of a data type.
	 *
	 * The properties are created with an initial $ symbol and
	 * the name of the property, and can include alphabetic characters,
	 * numbers and the _. No spaces are allowed. 
	 *
	 * By styleguide, the properties in PHP will be named with lowercase
	 * letters. Remember: PHP is case-sensitive. 
	 *
	 * Properties are created in the fly in PHP, at the first time you use
	 * them. Be aware: If you misspell a property name, PHP will not launch
	 * an error message, simply instead it will create a new property with
	 * your misspelled name.
	 *
	 * It is recommended that properties be created with initial values at
	 * the top of your program, or method or class.
